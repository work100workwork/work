              one - are here for you and are there if you need us. You are not alone</p>

              your
              life that you've remembered them even though they're gone.</p>

            <p>Mzamomtsha Primary School is proud to declare that we will be hosting a forum for anyone that wants
              to
              share anything about COVID-19 or ask any questions so that we all can become informed together. If you
              have
              any questions, you can post them on Twitter and tag them as #coronaaintamystery. Everyone's welcome,
              so
              please join us. COVID-19 has hit us all hard, and while we are happy to help gain knowledge, we would
              also
              like our students to learn. If anyone is willing to donate to our solidarity fund, we would love it.
